## [3.2.0] - 2025-02-22

### Changed

- Update chart to upgrade cray-service from ~10.0 to ~11.0. This is necessary to pick up changes required for CSM 1.7/K8s 1.32; specifically, a change to broaden a job condition check. Previously, checking for the successful completion of a job only required checking if the job condition was equal to `Success`. Now, we need to check for both `Success` and `SuccessCriteriaMet`.
